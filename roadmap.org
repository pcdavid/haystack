   Themes: packaging
   
   - [X] use a "haystack" namespace
   - [X] make it easier to invoke on the command-line
   - [X] start to abstract a notion of "project", first with just the configuration parameters
   - [X] don't hard-code the target directory
   - [X] publish this roadmap
   - [X] improve README and/or create a website
   - [X] cleanup dependencies
     - [X] use clojure.contrib.json instead of clj-json
     - [X] don't use contrib.duck-streams if 1.2 already has what I need
   - [X] initialize some basic tests
     - learn about Clojure test libraries

** Version 0.3 [0/5]

   Themes: code quality and web conversion

   - [ ] improve robustness (error handling and reporting)
   - [ ] add some internal documentation to functions
   - [ ] convert into a web application
     - learn about Ring, Compojure, and the Clojure web libraries ecosystem
   - [ ] merge both reports into a single one?
   - [ ] improve tests support
     - try to find an existing project which uses SVN and Trac

** Version 0.4 [0/2]

   Themes: UI

   - [ ] replace the monolithic report with a query form
     - produce a result page with only the requested information
     - keep the possibility to generate the full report

   Themes: architecture and performance

   - [ ] persist the indexed data
   - [ ] incremental mode
     - do not reload the whole history every time, just the data since the last refresh
   - [ ] abstract the different modules
     - prepare for other backends, e.g. Git/CVS/Hg for commit history,
       JIRA/Bugzilla for issues
     - also prepare for better configuration, e.g. how to extract the
       relevant tickets from a commit

** Version 0.6 [0/2]

   Themes: configuration and administration

   - [ ] administraction interface
     - definitions of the project parameters
   - [ ] support simple scheduling of the incremental updates

** Version 1.0 [0/4]

   Themes: polish

   - [ ] user documentation
   - [ ] add some simple statistics on the main page
     - number of commits
       - total/last month/last week/today
     - number of commiters
       - total/active this month/this week/today
     - mean/median/mode number of files changed by each commit
   - [ ] robustness
   - [ ] UI polish

** Beyond 1.0

   - add more reports, statistical analysis, metrics, etc. including graphics
     - learn more about statistics, Incanter
   - more dynamic interface
     - learn JavaScript, jQuery & co.
   - integrate with existing tools
     - Eclipse, JIRA, Hudson
   - support branches
     - e.g. limit searches and reports to certain branches or releases
   - more sophisticated search critertion
     - by date, branch, commiter/author, module/path...
   - more configurable
     - e.g. allow to ignore some paths which contain automatically
       generated code
   - stable and documented SPI to contribute bakcends/analyzers
   - REST API
