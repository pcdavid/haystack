Simple program to generate HTML reports of Trac issues vs source
files impacted in a project's source repository, using the SVN log
information.

To match Trac issues with SVN commits, the program assumes that the
ticket number appear on the first line of the commit message preceded
by a '#', e.g. "closes ticket #1234 - short description".
