Simple program to generate HTML reports of Trac issues vs source
files impacted in a project's source repository, using the SVN log
information.

To match Trac issues with SVN commits, the program assumes that the
ticket number appear on the first line of the commit message preceded
by a '#', e.g. "closes ticket #1234 - short description".

Invocation:

  % $PRINT_LOGS | lein run report $PATH_PREFIX $TICKET_PREFIX

where:

 * $PRINT_LOGS is a command which outputs the Subversion logs to
   analyze. These logs must be in XML and include for each commit the
   list of files/paths modified by the commit. Example:

      svn log -v --xml svn://path/to/my/project/trunk

 * $PATH_PREFIX is a fixed string to ignore at the beginning of the
   files' paths. This is useful to avoid noise in the report if your
   code is stored in a deep hierarchy inside the Subversion
   repository. Example: /path/to/my/project.

 * $TICKET_PREFIX is the base URL to use to reference a Trac ticket in
   the report's hyperlinks. Example:
   http://trac.mycompany.com/my-project/ticket/.
  

The resulting files are:

  result/report.html: a table reporting for each ticket the complete
    list of files which were modified to fix it.

  result/reverse-report.html: a table reporting for each file all the
    tickets which needed to modify it.
